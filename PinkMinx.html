    <h1>Begonia Pink Minx</h1>
    <p>Begonia 'Pink Minx' is a cane-like cultivar. The leaves are dark green and covered with splashes and blotches of silver-pink. The leaf shape is oval is with a lobed margin and a long apex. Pinching out tips of this hybrid when it is young will make it fuller as it grows. The flowers are pink and hang in small clusters. The female flowers have a rosy red ovary and pink petals. The combination of colorful foliage and bright pink flowers make this a gorgeous addition to any collection. This begonia needs higher humidity than most cane-type begonias; as such, it ends to lose a number of leaves in transit.</p>

    <p>Watering: keep soil moist but allow top two inches to dry between watering</p>
    <p>Light: indirect sunlight or high flourescent light</p>
