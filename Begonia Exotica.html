    <h1>Begonia Exotica</h1>
    <p>Begonia brevirimosa subsp. exotica stands out as one of the showiest of all begonia species. It is a real showstopper. This New Guinea species has a shrub-like growth habit and large leaves. The elliptic shaped leaves are a dark olive green with wide bands of metallic pink. This plant will get tall and as it does will need to be staked. The pink flowers form on a terminal inflorescence. This plant needs extra humidity. It will grow fine in a humid greenhouse or garden room, or it can be grown in a large terrarium.</p>

    <p>Watering: keep soil moist but allow top two inches to dry between watering</p>
    <p>Light: indirect sunlight or high flourescent light</p>
    <p>humidity: moderate to high</p>
