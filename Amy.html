    <h1>Begonia Maurice Amy</h1>
    <p>Begonia 'Maurice Amey' is a dazzling large cane-like begonia. The large leaves are a bright metallic pink with faint silver spots. The main veins are dark olive green. The back of the leaf is dark red. When it is getting ideal light (lots of bright light and a little sun) the leaves have a silver rim on them. This is a fast grower and branches readily. The flowers are bright pink and hang in small clusters. This outstanding variety was named after the late Maurice Amey, a hardworking, bright and funny member of the Southwest Region and American Begonia Society. It is sometimes erroneously labeled "Miss Mummy". This bright vigorous begonia is a fitting memory to him. This cultivar tolerates the heat.</p>
