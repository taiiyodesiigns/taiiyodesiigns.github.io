    <p>A combination of code and paint: My discovery of the disconnect between digital and fine arts. There are things that paint can do that digital programs can't do, and vice versa. This painting has shown me that although both creative outlets can work together, they are not interchangeable. Trying to make paint replicate the colors that a screen can display became futile, so I was forced to work with the colors and textures of the paint instead of against it. </p>
